It does not require pre-labeled anomalous examples for training, making it suitable for scenarios where anomalous patterns may evolve or change over time.\n",

These methods aim to identify data points that do not belong to any well-defined cluster or exhibit low density compared to the majority of the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "# . Dimensionality Reduction: Unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or Autoencoders, can be used to project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space. Anomalies can then be detected as data points that are far from the majority of the projected data points.\n",
